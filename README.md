# Bezalel Vivian Portfolio (React)

## Overview
This is a ready-to-run React portfolio project for **Bezalel Vivian Sales S**, built as a full project structure (like create-react-app).
It uses a dark theme, responsive layout, and includes Framer Motion for animations.

## How to run locally
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. In the project folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes
- The `package.json` included lists `react`, `react-dom`, and `framer-motion`. If you used `create-react-app` originally, you already have dev tooling; otherwise install `react-scripts` globally or use `npx create-react-app` as an alternative.
- Replace placeholder images and edit `src/Portfolio.js` to add more content.
